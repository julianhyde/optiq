/**
 * Describes the type of a mapping, from the most general {@link #MultiFunction}
 * (every element in the source and target domain can participate in many
 * mappings) to the most retricted {@link #Bijection} (every element in the
 * source and target domain must be paired with precisely one element in the
 * other domain).
 *
 * <p>Some common types:
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>A surjection is a mapping if every target has at least one source; also
 * known as an 'onto' mapping.
 * <li>A mapping is a partial function if every source has at most one target.
 * <li>A mapping is a function if every source has precisely one target.
 * <li>An injection is a mapping where a target has at most one source; also
 * somewhat confusingly known as a 'one-to-one' mapping.
 * <li>A bijection is a mapping which is both an injection and a surjection.
 * Every source has precisely one target, and vice versa.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Once you know what type of mapping you want, call {@link
 * Mappings#create(MappingType, int, int)} to create an efficient implementation
 * of that mapping.
